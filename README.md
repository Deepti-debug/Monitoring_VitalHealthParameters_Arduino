# Monitoring_VitalHealthParameters_Arduino
A multimodal device receives temporal data from a few sensors (ECG, EMG, GSR, Temp, Heart Rate). • This data is wirelessly transferred from the multimodal device to the Android phone.
• Monitoring_Arduino.ino - is the code responsible for sending the temporal data received from the sensors, to the android device in realtime.
• vital.jpeg - is the image showing the multimodal device in action.
